Based on the provided data, it seems that llamas can thrive in various environments and climates, as their lifespan ranges from 15 to 30 years. However, since we don't have specific information about their living locations or habitats, I'll provide some general insights:

Llamas are native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of present-day Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chile. They are adapted to high-altitude grasslands, shrublands, and agricultural areas.

In their natural habitat, llamas live in mountainous regions with moderate temperatures (around 10째C to 20째C or 50째F to 68째F), moderate rainfall (500 mm to 1,000 mm or 20 in to 39 in per year), and well-defined wet and dry seasons. They are also found in areas with low to moderate vegetation cover.

In domestic settings, llamas can thrive in a variety of environments, including:

1. Pastures: Llamas can live in grasslands, meadows, or pastures with suitable vegetation.
2. Agricultural farms: With proper care and management, llamas can be raised on farms that focus on crops like hay, corn, or other grains.
3. Hill stations: The cooler temperatures and moderate rainfall found at high elevations make hill stations a suitable habitat for llamas.

It's essential to note that llamas require adequate shelter from extreme weather conditions (e.g., intense sunlight, heavy rain, or strong winds) and access to clean water and nutritious food.
